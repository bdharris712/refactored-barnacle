    <h1>Dominos</h1>
    <p>It gets dark in the morning <br>
        Trade sleep for drinks in a bar <br>
        I'm sure as hell my breath stinks <br>
        Watch it float like smoke in the fog <br>
        I can feel a tornado <br>
        And it's shivering up my arms <br>
        I've been playing dominoes <br>
        I'm just trying not to wreck no cars <br>
        Putting fear in my nose <br>
        And trying to keep up with all my thoughts <br>
        <br>
        If we're going somewhere, I'm ready <br>
        If it's just dirt, I'm not <br>
        <br>
        I scrape my eye when I touch the sky <br>
        And lose a little vision for the man <br>
        I can call it in my mind <br>
        I don't want to hold nobody's hand <br>
        I can toss in the morning light <br>
        I'll play dead when I'm buried in the sand <br>
        I'm seeing shadows of a man who's <br>
        Homeless, buried and numb <br>
        A forecast of forgotten land <br>
        I hope it shows up in the setting sun <br>
        <br>
        If we're going somewhere, I'm ready, honey <br>
        If it's nowhere, I'm done <br><br>
        
        I can hear a voice but it's speaking code <br>
        Like I'm talking to strangers on a foreign phone <br>
        I can talk to angels when I'm all alone <br>
        They take me to a place in the city <br>
        And when we're done they take me home <br><br>
        
        Can't find a forest with the singing birds <br>
        Instead I'm just a low voice in the crowd <br>
        Can't hear my own voice in this crowd <br><br>
        
        I get edgy on dark streets <br>
        Coming home, I feel my heartbeat <br>
        I say I'm stoned for the last time <br>
        Do it again and repeat <br><br>
        
        I'm carpooling to kingdom come <br>
        Into the wild purgatory <br>
        Experience in a magic rainbow <br>
        All you got to do is follow <br><br>
        
        And if you're not feeling ready <br>
        There's always tomorrow <br>
        And if you're not feeling ready <br>
        There's always tomorrow</p>
    <p></p>
